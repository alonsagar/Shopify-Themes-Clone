# 🛍️ Shopify-Style Product Page

## 📖 Overview

This project is a fully responsive and interactive product detail page inspired by Shopify storefronts. Built using only **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it replicates core ecommerce features such as image galleries, variant selection, product bundles, modals, and recommendation sections. The layout is designed to mimic real-world storefronts with accessibility and usability in mind. No frameworks or libraries are used—making it lightweight and easy to understand.
